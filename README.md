                   I am a passionate Software Engineer, a quick learner and a natural collaborator who like to work in a team. My quick learning ability has helped me to learn new skills. I can adapt well to work in a fast-paced IT environment and I enjoy tackling problems as they arise. I am currently further up-skilling myself for a new career opportunity  to rejoin the IT workforce.
